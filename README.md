## 📌 Project Overview

This project showcases an end-to-end data analysis lifecycle in the banking sector. From data extraction and exploratory analysis to business intelligence reporting, the project aims to uncover key customer behavior patterns, high-risk profiles, and strategic growth opportunities.

I built this project from scratch, loading raw data into a MySQL database, performing comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python, and developing an interactive Power BI dashboard to deliver actionable insights.

## 🔍 Objectives

- Identify high-risk customer segments based on risk weighting and financial behavior.
- Understand customer loyalty classifications using behavioral patterns.
- Visualize banking metrics such as deposits, loans, account types, and credit card usage.
- Provide insights to support decision-making in credit risk management and customer retention.
